<!-- DIV -->

    <div> is a powerful element in HTML.
    It is the 'The one ring to rule them all'.

    <div> is a container that divides the page into sections
    <div> helps to apply CSS styles to a block of content.
    <div> element can hold various types of content, including text, images, videos, tables.

<!-- SEMANTIC HTML -->
    <div> elements were primary used to create groups or sections which have a common logical and visual behaviour on our webpage.

    In Semantic HTML - instead of using <div> - we use tags such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>.

    Once written in semantic html, the code is easier to read for other developers
    The code is also easier to read for screen readers and for SEO since they are able to under stand what each section of the code is supposed to represent

    The semantic elements - <header>, <nav> , <main> and <footer> constitute the structure of the webpage.

    <section> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme. <article> holds content that makes sense on its own such as articles, blogs, comments, etc.
